# The DeepDream Experiments 

This notebook is inspirated and associated with the [Google DeepDream algorithm](https://ai.googleblog.com/2015/06/inceptionism-going-deeper-into-neural.html),[DeepDream | Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/deepdream?hl=zh-cn) and [pytorch-deepdream by Aleksa GordiÄ‡](https://github.com/gordicaleksa/pytorch-deepdream/blob/master/deepdream.py) !


**A problem I haven't solved**

But I failed to use the tensorflow core, It always show that the 'keras' is mot defined, although I have check that the version of my tensorflow, make sure that the offical tensorflow contain the keras- gpu, and I have tried several version, it still does not work, so I back to pytorch to work on my project.


**Main Part**

In this project I'll be focusing on CNN: the VGG16.
